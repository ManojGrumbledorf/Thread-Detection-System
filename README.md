AI-Powered Threat Detection System ðŸš€
This repository is dedicated to building an AI-Powered Threat Detection and Response System, with the goal of understanding and implementing how artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged in the field of cybersecurity.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
The AI-Powered Threat Detection System will use machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. This project will progress step by step, with daily goals to gradually build a robust system capable of detecting anomalies, identifying known attacks, and responding to zero-day threats.


ðŸ“… Daily Progress Plan:
To maintain consistent progress, this project follows a daily task-based approach, with small steps aimed at gradually completing the larger goal of building a fully functional AI-powered cybersecurity system.

Stay tuned as we progress towards creating a next-generation threat detection system!
