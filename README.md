Here’s a description you can use for your GitHub repository, tailored to your goal of understanding AI's role in cybersecurity and gradually building an AI-Powered Threat Detection system:

AI-Powered Threat Detection System 🚀
This repository is dedicated to building an AI-Powered Threat Detection and Response System, with the goal of understanding and implementing how artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged in the field of cybersecurity.

📌 Project Overview:
The AI-Powered Threat Detection System will use machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. This project will progress step by step, with daily goals to gradually build a robust system capable of detecting anomalies, identifying known attacks, and responding to zero-day threats.

The project will incorporate various AI and machine learning models, alongside cybersecurity best practices, to:

Detect anomalies in network traffic
Classify known threats using supervised learning
Identify zero-day attacks using unsupervised learning
Automate threat response mechanisms to reduce response time and enhance security posture
🌟 Key Features (Future Goals):
Real-time threat detection based on user behavior, network traffic, and system logs.
Machine learning models to detect malware, phishing, DDoS, and insider threats.
Automated incident response with intelligent mitigation strategies.
Integration with a Security Operations Center (SOC) for monitoring and alerting.
🎯 Milestones:
Level 1: Setup Development Environment
Level 2: Implement Data Collection and Preprocessing
Level 3: Create a Basic Anomaly Detection System
Level 4: Supervised Learning for Known Attacks
Level 5: Unsupervised Learning for Zero-Day Threats
Level 6: Develop Automated Response Mechanisms
Level 7: Integrate with SOC Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring
💡 Why AI in Cybersecurity?
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to transform cybersecurity by enabling faster and more accurate threat detection, reducing human error, and automating response mechanisms. This project aims to explore these benefits and create a system that can proactively secure digital infrastructures.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies:
